# Friend-Finder

Do you need a friend? If you do, you should try out this friend finder! This app asks you 10 questions and takes your responses and compares them to existing users. It will compare each question with the matching question per person within the database. Once you submit your responses, you will be added into the database as well. 

## Demo

You can find a live demo of my friend finder application [here](https://mighty-wave-68991.herokuapp.com).

## Functionality
Upon going to the site, you are presented with this landing page. Here you can click the big blue button to go to the survey, or the smaller bottons to see the database, or see the Github repo that holds the code of this page.
